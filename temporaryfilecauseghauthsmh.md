## Naming, Branding, Logos, ect

Capitalization should be dependent on the type of project.

If you are developing a software that targets non-developers, capitalize the first letter of the "brand name", make sure you have a logo, and make the project generally "marketable". If you're devleoping a developer tool that will mostly be used by fellow developers, then capitalization can be a bit more unique. If you're making a developer tool that's primary use is as an executable, make it fully lowercase, no delimeters between words. If it's a web-development related project, use camelCase.

In more detail:

| Project type | Description | Capitalization Guide | Exmaple | Notes  |
|--------------|-------------|----------------------|--------|-----------|
| "for normie-users" | Apps & Especially Websites, that have a target audience of "non-developers" | Uppercase; "Standard" Title Format | `Word`, `Word Word`, `Word a Word`, `Word Word Word`, `A Word` | All words' first letters are capitalized, just like in formal writing. Articles like `a`, `the`, ect, are not capitalzed unless they are the first word. |
| "webdev"      | "Developer-facing" tools that have a target audience of programmers and "nerds" and relate to webdev | camelCase | `word`, `wordWord`, `wordAWord`, `aWord` | Everything is lowecase, only the first letter of a word that is after another word is uppercase. Articles vs actual words have no difference. |
