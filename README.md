# fancyui

A cross-platform ui library

fancyui does not render the actual user interface, it just defines the ui's layout and styling properties.

fancyui should be used with a "renderer":

fancytui is a renderer for fancyui, specifically for rendering to the command line as a text-ui or "tui" (see fancytui's github [here](https://github.com/EhanAhamed/fancytui))

fancygui is another renderer for fancyui, specifically for graphical something something (see fancygui's github somewhere i didnt make it yet lol)

> note to self: mabye the names are too similar and i should rename one of them lol
